=== Writing Verticles

Writing a Verticle with Kotlin is achieved the same way you write a Java Verticle by
extending the {@link io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle}.

Here's an example verticle:

[source, kotlin]
----
import io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle

class MyVerticle : AbstractVerticle() {

  // Called when verticle is deployed
  override fun start() {
  }

  // Optional - called when verticle is undeployed
  override fun stop() {
  }
}
----

Please refer to the Java documentation.
