import io.vertx.core.file.OpenOptions

/**
 * A function providing a DSL for building [io.vertx.core.file.OpenOptions] objects.
 *
 * Describes how an [io.vertx.core.file.AsyncFile] should be opened.
 *
 * @param append  Whether the file should be opened in append mode. Defaults to <code>false</code>.
 * @param create  Set whether the file should be created if it does not already exist.
 * @param createNew  Set whether the file should be created and fail if it does exist already.
 * @param deleteOnClose  Set whether the file should be deleted when it's closed, or the JVM is shutdown.
 * @param dsync  Set whether every write to the file's content will be written synchronously to the underlying hardware.
 * @param perms  Set the permissions string
 * @param read  Set whether the file is to be opened for reading
 * @param sparse  Set whether a hint should be provided that the file to created is sparse
 * @param sync  Set whether every write to the file's content and meta-data will be written synchronously to the underlying hardware.
 * @param truncateExisting  Set whether the file should be truncated to zero length on opening if it exists and is opened for write
 * @param write  Set whether the file is to be opened for writing
 *
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: This function has been automatically generated from the [io.vertx.core.file.OpenOptions original] using Vert.x codegen.
