/**
 * A function providing a DSL for building [io.vertx.amqp.AmqpReceiverOptions] objects.
 *
 * Configures the AMQP Receiver.
 *
 * @param autoAcknowledgement  Sets the auto-acknowledgement. When enabled (default), the messages are automatically acknowledged. If set to <code>false</code>, the messages must be acknowledged explicitly using [io.vertx.amqp.AmqpMessage], [io.vertx.amqp.AmqpMessage] and [io.vertx.amqp.AmqpMessage].
 * @param capabilities  Sets the list of desired capabilities A registry of commonly defined source capabilities and their meanings is maintained at <a href="http://www.amqp.org/specification/1.0/source-capabilities">AMQP Source Capabilities</a>.
 * @param capabilitys  Adds a desired capability. A registry of commonly defined source capabilities and their meanings is maintained at <a href="http://www.amqp.org/specification/1.0/source-capabilities">AMQP Source Capabilities</a>.
 * @param durable  Sets the durability. <p> Passing <code>true</code> sets the expiry policy of the source to <code>NEVER</code> and the durability of the source to <code>UNSETTLED_STATE</code>.
 * @param dynamic  Sets whether the link remote terminus to be used should indicate it is 'dynamic', requesting the peer names it with a dynamic address. <p> The address provided by the peer can then be inspected using the [io.vertx.amqp.AmqpReceiver] method on the [io.vertx.amqp.AmqpReceiver] received once opened.
 * @param linkName
